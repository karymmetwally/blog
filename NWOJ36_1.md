## In the News 

### UAE introduces first-ever 9% corporate tax

The United Arab Emirates has introduced a 9% business tax with exemptions for numerous free zones as the formerly tax-free oil producer seeks to boost non-oil revenue and remain a regional commercial hub.

As of June 1, firms began being liable for corporate tax when their financial years start, meaning tax returns will not fall due until 2025.

The UAE's 9% rate on taxable income over 375,000 dirhams (about $100,000) follows a 5% value added tax (VAT) introduced in 2018. 

That said, 

+ Qualified entities in more than 30 UAE free zones that export tens of billions of dollars worth of goods to neighboring states will not be taxed.
+ UAE also does not levy personal income taxes.
+ The United Arab Emirates legislation thus levies 0% or 9%, but with caveats for smaller earners and excluding personal income from employment, investment and real estate.

> The UAE is not giving up its tax-free status just yet. The tax incentive helped it carve out a role as an international trade and tourism hub and magnet for the ultra-rich.

###  North Macedonia's real estate investment boom sends prices soaring

Macedonians are increasingly looking to invest in real estate to protect the value of their savings amid high inflation and financial uncertainty, a trend that has pushed up  real estates prices in the capital Skopje. As inflation erodes the value of savings, investing in real estate has become the preferred alternative.

> Rising prices haven’t dented the demand for newly built apartments in Skopje, which has become an attractive destination for both investors and homebuyers seeking long-term security and value, real estate professionals.

### Russia’s war in Ukraine has brought a new importance to Central Asia (the stans)

The war in Ukraine presented the stans with new opportunities. Russia, China, the European Union and the United States have noticeably increased their engagement with Central Asia since the Russian military invasion of Ukraine in February last year. 

> This area has more resources and manufacturing capacity than the rest of the world, great demographics and low debt. However, preserving relations with both Russia, China, and the West during these turbulent times has become a balancing act.

### Turkey is getting ready

Turkey is getting ready for an unprecedented invasion of  Russian tourists this summer in the wake of Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s re-election as president.

Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the first international leaders to congratulate his “dear friend” Erdogan on his victory last week. Russian tourists, draft dodgers and billionaire oligarchs trying to circumvent sanctions have poured into the country since their options for travel became severely limited due to the war in Ukraine.

> A sheer  number (7mn tourists) are expected to flock in Turkey this summer. They will bring along needed Dollars to relieve Turkey's forex negative reserve... Already the black market Lira rate is already in the 24's on its way to 25 for the dollar. Looks like it won't be the fast and violent devaluation that would make the Turkish equity market super juicy, but rather a consistent bleeding.

### Sanctions seems to be beneficial to Russia .. but with a caveat

The number of Russians with above average income rose by 10 million. And, the number of Russians with upper-middle income increased by 9.4 million in 2022 to 53.1 million.

The share of people with monthly incomes with 45,000 rubles or more, which is higher than the national average, has climbed to 36.2%.

The increased social benefits helped the lower income portion of the population to grow faster. In addition, the Russian economy will continue to grow despite sanctions thanks to a higher-than-expected energy revenues. Moscow has altered the destination of its oil exports without a material change in volume.

But the caveat ... the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is worried that the Russian economy is overheating due to high levels of investment and rising consumption.

Indeed , the economic temperature is rising thanks to increased consumer spending, private investment focused on import substitution to replace missing goods following an exodus of foreign companies and their brands, as well as rising strong consumer demand since consumers go back to buying bigger ticket items after the dislocation caused by the imposition of Western sanctions.

At the same time, supply is struggling to keep up with rising demand, especially with a very tight labour market posing a risk of overheating.

> Sanctions seems to be a beneficial incentives for Russia’s economy but the danger of overheating as war shocks wear off is omnipresent.

Tehran will create a gas hub in the Persian Gulf with the participation of Russia, Turkmenistan and Qatar.

The new gas hub will be established in the south of Iran in the industrial region of Asaluyeh located on the coast of the Persian Gulf. Iran has the world's second-largest proven gas reserves, with 33 trillion cubic meters of recoverable resources.

> Thats a powerful group!! ... The plan is to turn the Persian Gulf and Asaluyeh into a gas hub. This, with the logistical assistance of Russia and Turkmenistan and Qatar's money. Tehran is already discussing cooperation with Moscow on ten oil and gas fields and work on some of them is already ongoing. Iran is an especially attractive country. One day it will be investment heaven.

### ☞ Natural gas up

Perhaps this is the bottom, perhaps not but with rigs being cut in America the natty and coal equities look increasingly attractive to me.

### ☞ Uranium 

the largest single source of uranium supply has pretty much been locked up just as utilities come to market to sign new contracts. I wonder what that means?

## My Opinion 

###  The Saudi's energy-inflation switch

The demand side inflation is due to the fact the West is printing fiat money, while the supply side inflation is due to energy prices increase. It's obvious that the recent decline in Europe's inflation is due mainly to a drop in energy prices and only to a slight extent  to a decrease in food prices (fertilizers). What does this mean? Simply put, if Saudi Arabia increases energy prices once again, we will see a returning high inflation in Europe. And guess what? Saudi Arabia is due to raise oil prices in July. 

This is what I call the Saudi switch. Looks like a clear explanation who plays against whom. A Saudi decrease in supply in the liquefied natural gas market and a cut of 1 million barrels per day in July will surely send prices soaring. And this will be amplified by a potentially higher demand in Asia. And the constant craving in Europe .. and the fact that the U.S needs to refill its depleted oil reserve at lower prices. And of course, the ACs are on now because of the hot summer season. Energy works both ways... Inflation will increase in the West and western banks would face some difficulties with commercial real estate due to higher interest rates and remote work.

### More regulations for Crypto 

Regulatory bodies such as the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) already went after Binance and Coinbase.

### So many layoffs happened in IT

It turns out that managers are to blame. To please their ego in the company, they hired more people under them. 

More departments with more people means more power means more money. So when the manager comes to manage a department with three people, and after a year he is managing three departments with 18 people, then he is managing five departments and more and more etc.

That's how it turned out that Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others sucked in thousands and tens of thousands of useless managers, hiring thousands of useless people.

Now with the war in Ukraine and AI, the situation has changed, the costs need to be cut. 

Oh,  and AI is all over the place, soon it will replace the coffee machine copywriter.

The interesting thing here is that all this hiring frenzy has been building up the capitalization of the IT giants as well. 

> Where do the managers bonuses that depend on the subordinate's bonuses managers go? The bubble- they pretends to be quietly and efficiently deflating-is about to burst loudly and there will be a fever in the markets. We won't have to wait too long.

###  More than $1.3 billion of American taxpayers' money has been sent to China and Russia

In the past 5 years, more than one billion of US Dollars has been paid to organizations in China through U.S. grants and contracts, and another $870 million has been paid to companies in Russia. Here are just a few of the projects financed by U.S. taxpayers:

▪️ $58.7 million from the State Department, including $96,875 for gender equality through a New Yorker magazine cartoon exhibition;
▪️ $51.6 million from the Department of Defense, including $6 million for technical support of military deployment and distribution software - equipment delivery and supplies;
▪️ $4.2 million from healthcare and social services, including $770,466 for a state laboratory in Russia to train cats on treadmill;
▪️ $2.4 million for Russian alcohol and drug research;
▪️ $2 million directed to China's Wuhan Institute of Virology for dangerous experiments on bat and transgenic mice coronaviruses;
▪️ $1.6 million to Chinese companies from the National School Lunch Program;
▪️ $1.45 million to track the pandemic virus

The full list is larger. It includes various individual entrepreneurs, law firms, and security companies. 

> The list goes on .. It's clear that some of the money went towards legitimate contracts, such as those with RosCosmos. But what about the rest? How much went towards illegitimate companies?
