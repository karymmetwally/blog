### Being a Bit of a Loser

![bitloser](/bitloser.jpg)

I am an early retired or unemployed whatever you want to call it. During the covid pandemic most people stayed at home and suddenly both employed and unemployed have become the same. We were all equal in staying at home, did this make feel better? Yes, in a way, but I was already satisfied with my early retirement and already felt good about myself. You might be labeled as a loser or a failure, but in fact you might be happier than most people, more creative, more humble. It is really how you define success that makes you a successful person or a failure. I would rather be labeled as a loser than being stressed out to be socially acceptable and positive all the time. So my advice be a bit of a loser from time to time.

### Jeddawi 

![1696779527444](/1696779527444.jpg)

Hassan Bey Al-Jeddawi was a Mamluk slave abducted at an early age from the plains of western Georgia. This 15-year-old kid was not the shy type. He had more of a penchant for fighting.This prince was one of Egypt's greatest heroes. Alas, this mamluk of Georgian origin is still unknown until now. As if history had forgotten him.
Reckless, courageous, adventurous, these are the descriptions that draw well the unique personality of one of the greatest prince and commander of the Middle East.Hassan Bey's tactics should be taught in top military schools. He led a military campaign against the Bedouins, the Mohametans. As well as against the largest army during this period: the French army under the command of Bonaparte. But he also valiantly fought the Ottomans who were represented by the reign of Mohamed Ali.Accounts of his exploits are quoted in many chronicles. The most important of which is that of the historian Al-Jabarti. The chronicles attest to his Abkhazian (Georgian) origin. They also attest that his kheshdashs (colleagues) were of Abkhazian origin. His name is also mentioned in many books and novels. He was also quoted in the novel "Anastasius" by Thomas Hope.All the enemies testified to his bravery and his cunning. And his skill in riding and fighting had become well known in Egypt and abroad by the end of the eighteenth century.

### Djeddaoui

![djeddaoui](/djeddaoui.jpg)

Hassan Bey Al-Djeddaoui était un Mamlouk esclave enlevé dés son plus tendre âge des plaines de l'ouest de la Géorgie. Ce petit gosse de 15 ans, n'était pas du genre timide. Il avait plutôt un penchant pour les bagarres.

Ce prince était l'un des plus grand héros de l'Égypte. Helas, ce mamlouk d'origine Géorgienne est encore méconnu jusqu'à présent. Comme si l'histoire l'avait oublié

Téméraire, courageux, aventurier, ce sont les descriptions qui dessinent bien la personnalité unique d'un des plus grands prince et commandant du moyen-Orient.

The following meditations are the distilled experiences I have accumulated over 20 years of investment in real estates, crypto, stocks, antiques in Egypt, Turkey and Georgia. I hope it will serve you in your quest to battle the investor's worst enemy namely inflatory pressures which are created by governments printing fiat money. The meditations show my asymmetric style of investment and so far it has benefited me well .. I must thank God for that boon.
