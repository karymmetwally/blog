### Being a Bit of a Loser

![bitloser](/bitloser.jpg)

I am an early retired or unemployed whatever you want to call it. During the covid pandemic most people stayed at home and suddenly both employed and unemployed have become the same. We were all equal in staying at home, did this make feel better? Yes, in a way, but I was already satisfied with my early retirement and already felt good about myself. You might be labeled as a loser or a failure, but in fact you might be happier than most people, more creative, more humble. It is really how you define success that makes you a successful person or a failure. I would rather be labeled as a loser than being stressed out to be socially acceptable and positive all the time. So my advice be a bit of a loser from time to time.
