**The Staring Kid**

The kid was staring at me. He kept looking while detangling my  ear phone. I looked back, and he just looked away. I resumed fixing my earphone. Put the plug in the mobile, switched on the application and started playing music. He kept looking. I asked him what he was looking at. He replied that he was looking at nothing. I could have persevered but decided to just let it go.
