Tips for Liver Health

The single most important step to protecting your liver health is 

+ lowering your seed oil content as much as possible. Please review the comprehensive article and video on LA I posted earlier this year.
+  Limiting alcohol
+  environmental pollutants like glyphosate and PFAS are also important
+ be sure to add in choline-rich foods like pastured egg yolks, which are known to support liver health.
+ Vitamin B12 and folic acid may also be protective and have been found to decrease the progression of NASH.
+ Niacinamide, also known as nicotinamide (NAM), is another option. It’s a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a vital signaling molecule that’s believed to play an important role in longevity. 
+  supplementation with NAM has also been found to decrease oxidative stress and prevent fatty liver
+ N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor needed for glutathione biosynthesis, is another liver-supportive agent to be aware of. NAC is used as an antidote for acetaminophen toxicity, which causes liver damage by depleting glutathione. Research published in Hepatitis Monthly has shown NAC supplementation helps improve liver function in patients with NAFLD.
+ Adding 5 to 15 grams per day of the ==amino acid glycine== would also be useful.
+ Another option is ==milk thistle,== which contains silymarin and silybin, antioxidants that are known to help protect your liver from toxins and even help regenerate liver cells.
+ Supplements should always be used in combination with living a healthy lifestyle, including eating right and exercising. 
+ If you’re overweight, losing 7% to 10% of your body weight can improve NAFLD, including lowering liver fat content, liver inflammation and fibrosis.
