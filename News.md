### Shipping companies halt Red Sea shipments due to Houthi attacks

The world's two largest container shipping lines said Friday they were suspending transit through the Red Sea after their ships were attacked.

A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, the world’s second-largest owner of container ships, said in a statement on Friday that it has instructed its vessels heading for the southern entrance of the Red Sea to pause their voyages.

Its vessel Maersk Gibraltar was attacked.

Shortly after Maersk’s announcement, Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd AG announced a halt until Monday, “then will decide for the period after.”

Over the past few days, the Houthi attacks seem to have intensified and the links of individual ships to Israel have become less obvious.

At least three container ships have been attacked or disabled near Yemen in the past 24 hours.

Disruptions in the area suggests that the risks to the industry as a whole are increasing and the cost of insurance is rising.
